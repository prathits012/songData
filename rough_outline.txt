Look at spotify top 50 US using spotify web API, (can add current billboard songs)
Grab the lyrics of the 50 songs using Genius API,
Do some analysis using the audio features from spotify,
Make an website that shows this analysis,
Publish the code that does the backend/dirty work to AWS Lamda,


TODO:
Get Top 50 Songs from spotify playlist (using base URL)
	1. Take ID's to grab each song's features in spotify and make a new Dict
	2. Build a dictionary with the songs to input into genius.py to grab lyrics

Figure out what we want to do with the features given (what sparks joy/innovation) and the lyrics from Genius
	1. Make a list of common word to filter out of the dictionary
	2. Maybe a dictionary of words from Genius Lyrics (







Stretch Goals:
	- Look into each song's lyrics for mentions that can tie the song to a genre/audio feature(s) or learn/explain some trends in music culture that arent obvious
		- This can include seasonal/specific things that can be graphed like google trends ot show some sort of trend in the music
		- Google Trends Esc
		- Use searchbar to create custom google trends like graph based on the lyrics in the top 50 (add side meta data with yearly avg or something similar)
		- Display current general trends of the playlist to the user like (Today's Popular Genre in the US is Rap (yesterday's was pop))
	- Wordcloud of song lyrics for top 200/50
		- Make the wordcloud in the shape and color of the top song's album/single cover picture
	- Spotify Daily Wrapped based on region (uses 1 template for all regions)
		- Stats based on each genre  with fun things including word clouds
			- Top genres (change in torch bearing and stream data too, pop 800,000 -> rap 1,000,000)
			- Top words in songs right now
			- Most popular popular artist (most streams within top 200/50)
			- Clicking on one of these things will bring someone for more in-depth details
			- Daily movement (how many things shifted)
	- Average features by genre (plus cool tidbits per wek cycle (can do some random thing in a list to run each time we update)
		- have a list of cool things to display for the genre (do a rand int to decide what to display on the given day)
	- Most popular song/artist of today/this week last year
	- Chart similarity between countries/markets (can use that special distance metric from 485)
